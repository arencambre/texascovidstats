Get a bounding box that is a polygon of Texas. Because Texas is a large state and has a lot of undulations in its borders, this may be a large query.
```{r}
texas_counties <- st_read("gis/Texas_County_Boundaries-shp/County.shp")

texas_counties %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = "NAD83", datum = "NAD83")

```
