Get a bounding box that is a polygon of Texas. Because Texas is a large state and has a lot of undulations in its borders, this may be a large query.
```{r}
bbx <- getbb("Texas, United States of America", format_out = "polygon")
x <- opq(bbox = "Texas, United States of America") %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "boundary",
                  value = "administrative") %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "admin_level",
                  value = "6") %>%
  osmdata_sf()
```
